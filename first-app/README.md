# Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that extends the capabilities of React by providing a full-stack development environment. While React is primarily a client-side JavaScript library, Next.js introduces features that enable server-side rendering and a unified approach to building both the client and server parts of a web application.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Unified Development:** Next.js allows you to build both the client and server parts of your project within the same codebase.

- **File-Based Routing:** The framework simplifies routing by using a file-based approach, making it intuitive and easy to navigate.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js supports SSR, where the finished HTML page is generated on the server and sent to the client. This approach is beneficial for SEO and initial page load performance.

- **React Integration:** As a React framework, Next.js seamlessly integrates with React, leveraging its component-based structure.

## Server-Side Rendering vs. Client-Side Rendering

In traditional React applications, the client-side JavaScript code is responsible for generating and rendering content. In contrast, Next.js adopts SSR, where the server renders the HTML content and sends it to the client. This can improve SEO and provide a faster initial rendering of pages.

## Building Next.js Apps

Next.js provides two main routing approaches:

### 1. Page Router

- **Older Way:** The traditional and stable approach for building full-stack apps with React.

### 2. App Router

- **New Way:** Introduced in Next.js 13, the App Router is marked as stable but may still have some issues.
  
- **Support for Modern Next.js and React:** The App Router supports the latest features of Next.js and React.

- **Future of Next.js:** Considered the future of Next.js, the App Router is expected to become the standard way of building applications.

Next.js empowers developers to create feature-rich, full-stack applications with the flexibility to choose between the stable Page Router and the more modern App Router.
