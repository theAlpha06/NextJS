Some data doesn't need to be prerendered
  - Data changing with high frequency (eg. stock data)
  - Highly user-specific data (eg. last orders in an online shop)
  - Partial data (eg. data that's onlu used on a part of an page)

Pre-fetching the data for page generation might not work or be required
"Traditional" client-side data fetching (eg. useEffect() with fetch() is fine)
