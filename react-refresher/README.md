# Understanding JSX in React

JSX, or JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension to JavaScript commonly used with React to define the structure of the user interface. It offers a familiar HTML-like syntax while harnessing the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React "elements," and rendering them to the DOM is explored in the next section.

## Key Concepts:

- **File Structure:**
  - `main.jsx` serves as the main entry file.
  - `package.json` manages dependencies in Node.js projects.

- **Importing Files:**
  - Omit file extensions (`.jsx` or `.js`) while importing files.

- **Components:**
  - Components are functions that return JSX code.
  
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - JSX custom elements start with a capital letter.
  - HTML elements start with a lowercase letter.

## Example:

```jsx
// main.jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>Hello, JSX!</div>;
};
